# About this project

This repo contains the following items:

- **C++:**
  - Operator Overload: A nice way to implement your usage of any basic operator such as +, -, *, /, [], = and more. Only need to implement methods called operator<op> inside the classes you created. For instance, method "operator+" redefines what the usage of "+" can do for the class created.

- **MatLab:**
  - Command Window Easter Eggs: For example, if you type "fifteen" in the command line, then this GUI shows up.
